Usage: `python avalon.py player1,player2,...,playerN role1,role2,...,roleM`

Example: `python avalon.py alice,bob,charlie,denise,eve,frank,george merlin,percival,morgana`

Player names can be whatever.

Roles can be `merlin`, `mordred`, `percival`, `morgana`, `snape`.
One evil player will be given the role `assassin` if snape or merlin is in the game.

The code is hopefully self-explanatory.

It would be better if this worked on a phone.
